# What is it 

This is a simple linear regression model implementation using sklearn.  
The model will predict the student marks based on the amount of hours studied.  

It involves only 2 variables:
- Amount of hours studied 
- Percentage marks.  

I used a small dataset to make it easier to model ([can be found here](http://bit.ly/w-data))


I then made a web app using the module `streamlit`
